        <h3> 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
        <p>IT is and has been an integral part of business, a clear example of this which can be applied to a whole
            range of industries is databases such as MySQL. Product information, stock and other data can be
            stored and controlled using databases like this. IT also benefits businesses by providing them with
            advertisement through promotional graphic design and computer graphics which could be implemented in TV or
            internet (such as on YouTube) advertisements. Online shopping is an incredibly strong market in the modern
            age, with 67% of millennials and 56% of gen-xers preferring to shop online, the two generations of the
            future. - https://www.thebalancesmb.com/compare-brick-and-mortar-stores-vs-online-retail-sites-4571050</p>

        <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully - what do you
            need
            to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h3>
        <p>Some important methods which can ensure a successful digital project are ensuring that deadlines are stuck to
            and that any possible problems ar eflagged up early and are effectively dealt with. Also, it is important to
            not push the boundaries of projects too much, attempting to include to omany features than is possible in
            your timeframe. While tempting, this could just bring additional stress for you or your team, while ensuring
            that you waste time not working on the actual core of your project. -

            For a digital project to succeed it is
            important for all involved in the process to be effective communicators - whether this applies to teamwork
            collaboration or communicating and updating the client as the project goes along. -
            https://www.mediavisioninteractive.com/digital-marketing-2/10-tips-for-effective-digital-project-management/
            Another important aspect
            is attention to detail, pertaining both to code and context. While it is important to notice any errors in
            code or a method to execute a certain feature, it is also important that the user experience and actual
            content of the project is not compromised. In temrs of resources and tools, as well as Trello there are some
            other useful management systems such as Float or Google Calender which can help divvy up tasks and set
            deadlines. - https://www.float.com/?utm_source=dpm&utm_content=rms Using an agile development method might
            be the most effectiv emethod for a larger project os that
            the project can be delivered early/on-time but continually improved and changes in the market/tech can be
            responded to. - https://www.cio.com/article/3156998/agile-project-management-a-beginners-guide.html</p>

        <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to
            your
            Trello board.</h3>
        <p>First I shall write out all my blog content in a pages document. Then I will plan my website by creating a
            brief sketch for how I think the different pages of my website should look and what should be included in
            them - such as any images and where I think these should go. I shall then input the content I have created
            in my pages document onto VS Code as a HTML file, ensuring that each page for the website is in a different
            HTML file. I shall also add CSS to ensure that my website has a distinct style.
            <p>This is a link to my Trello board: <a class="trello"

        <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects - what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3>
        <p>There are two types of possible risk: internal (such as stakeholders or availability of resources) and
            external risk (regulatory changes or competitor activity). One key internal issue that could impact the
            successfulness of a digital project is not having a clearly defined minimum viable product (MVP), decided
            with yourself or with the client you are working for. The MVP can then be worked on further with updates, or
            in pre-release depending how far along schedule the development team is, but ultimately the MVP ensures that
            the project will be workable and live by a deadline - rather than allowing ‘scope creep’ - when there is
            uncontrolled growth in a projects scope and ambition. -
            https://www.thirdandgrove.com/four-risks-will-kill-your-digital-project-you-dont-even-know-look ;
            https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/top-five-causes-scope-creep-6675Another example of risk could relate to
            the actual
            technology itself rather than poor management, for example the deployment of a new operating system could
            effect whether your website or app is functional on the newest version. </p>

        <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the
            right kind of technology for the job?
        </h3>
        <p>First it is important to assess what your needs or the client’s needs are when choosing the correct software
            for the job, as you can then tailor the software to fit your specific requirements rather than just choosing
            something which is perhaps the most up to date or the most on trend at that moment. Another important
            consideration, as Siddharth at Tutsplus highlights, when choosing a framework to develop from it is
            important to note that it is open source or at least can be used commercially
            -https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/15-important-considerations-for-choosing-a-web-dev-framework--net-8035
        </p>
        <p>If the availability and usability of your chosen technologies and frameworks are not taken into account
            prior to development this could mean that your website or app is developed but then it cannot be
            commercially deployed due to copyright issues or other hold ups with licensing. A library, such as AJAX, of
            code which is inbuilt into most frameworks is another important consideration so that you can accurately and
            easily program in your chosen languages with the software intuitively knowing what you are typing. As
            opensource.com note it is also important to ensure that your chosen technology has strong ‘maintainership’,
            it will be getting frequent updates to ensure its longevity and usability -
            https://opensource.com/article/18/3/pick-right-technology</P>
        <p> It is best to try and build your solution in the simplest way, whether this means using the
            most modern technology or a language that you know best and know you can implement all the features you want
            with this language. In terms of web development, building a landing page with technology such as Wordpress
            or Unbounce could be the best option because this helps to save time and implement a landing page without
            having to totally build it from scratch. -

        </p>
        <p> Security could become the most important factor if the end result of our project will collect
            collect users data then it could perhaps be the most important factor. So when contemplating security as a
            factor it is first important to figure out exactly what you need to keep secure to then decide which
            software to use or which tools to implement to keep it secure - furthermore security also depends on the
            skillset of the developer and whether they have written their code without many weaknesses.-

        </p>
        <p> Horizontal scalability - the ability of a web application to accommodate more requests. So, an
            app must be able to work if the number of users continues to grow. Vertical scalability - the ability to add
            new components to a web application without damaging its performance. It is important to ensure that
            whatever technology I am using caters to both of these needs, in case the application becomes more popular
            than intended or if there is a need to add new features. -

        <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes -
            How
            has Trello helped you plan and can git and GitHub help with your codes version control?</h3>
        <p>
            Trello: Effective method for breaking down tasks and also therefore ensuring that nothing is missed while
            developing something - when looking at the big picture I can sometimes miss the smaller but just as
            important details.</p>
        <p>GitHub: Git and GitHub are especially useful for ensuring that changes to a system are recorded overtime so
            that you can always access and recall earlier versions later. For example, if you are a ‘web designer and
            want to keep every version of an image of layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control
            System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use.’
            -https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control This is because it allows you to
            revert files or the entire
            project back to a previous state if there is an issue and you can view who and when something was last
            modified, to ensure that the problem can be overcome.</p>

        <h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects - how does GDPR impact digital
            projects?</h3>
        <p>One of the most crucial elements of the new GDPR, or general data protection regulation, is that it should be
            easier for people to withdraw their consent for data processing. The Information Commissioner’s Office
            stated that the main impact of GDPR was ‘Telling people they have the right to withdraw their consent at any
            time, and how to do this. It must be as easy to withdraw as it was to give consent. This means you will need
            to have simple and effective withdrawal mechanisms in place.’ -
            https://www.edelman.co.uk/insights/how-will-gdpr-impact-digital-marketing-professionals Some of the more
            specific rights of GDPR refer
            to the right to access which means that ‘individuals have the right to request access to their personal data
            and to ask how their data is used by the company after it has been gathered’ and the right to be forgotten
            which means that ‘if consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw their consent from a company to
            use their personal data, then they have the right to have their data deleted.’ -
            https://www.superoffice.com/blog/gdpr/ Therefore, much of GDPR gives
            individuals more right to have control over their data and restrict the way that corporations and businesses
            use that data, at the very least ensuring that the consumer has some idea about what their data is being
            used for or if there data is being used at all. <br>
            However, GDPR could perhaps have a positive impact for digital projects attempting to collect data for
            monetary gain but a negative impact for the consumer. Enza Iannopollo, a Forrester senior analyst for risk
            and security, states that ‘one of the changes we’re starting to see is the preference for first-party data,
            the data which comes directly from the consumer, because you have consent and the customer trusts you…
            because of that trust, they’re going to provide you with more accurate information, more relevant
            information - because with consent, if you’re transparent and I trust you, more likely I’m going to share
            more data with you.’ -
            https://www.zdnet.com/article/gdpr-how-europes-digital-privacy-rules-have-changed-everything/ So GDPR could
            actually mean that more accurate data is complied, which could be more
            useful or companies that benefit from collecting and creating data profiles. </p>
