        <h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
        <p>The landing page has a brief description of me as a person and my interests, such as playing music, in large
            white text with a gif below which contains clips from the 1980s movie Akira. I chose to include a
            self-created gif of this movie because is because it goes with the aesthetic theme of my website which is an
            80s vapourware inspired theme and also I am a fan of this film! It also has a button which takes you to the
            next page which is a further about me section which gives a more detailed description of me than the initial
            landing page and has a gif of the playstation logo in the background. From here there is a navigation bar to
            check out the outcomes. The first outcome page contains
            an image of a red spaceman with my answers next to it in a black colour. The next outcome page contains gifs
            of packman going across the screen with a red border which contains the text on a black background. Unit 1,
            Outcomes 2 has a gif of an 8bit Charizard on a white background with the headings for the questions being
            contained in a blue border. The answers are then below teh titles in a standard format, with the text being
            aligned left but generally it is in the middle due to margins. The Unit 2 page has a retro computer gif with
            the text over it. The text has a somewhat transparent background behind it so that it is readable but so
            that the computer gif behind it is still visible.

        <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites
        </h3>
        <p>The UK law for copyright is the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 and it protects original creations
            involving literary work, music, art, film and sound. There is also an additional law called the Copyright
            (Computer Programs) Regulations 1992 which extends protection to software. Under the UK law creative works
            are protected when they are created/published and so as soon as a website is posted online you are then
            protected immediately under copyright. However, it is still recommended to register with the UK Copyright
            Service because websites, especially with the highly accessible nature of information and images on the
            internet, are easily subject to abuses by the general public. Another important constraint that web
            designers and developers must be aware of is flexibility. When building a website it is important to note
            that
            users and viewers will stretch and distort the designs contained within your website and that they will
            access the website on different browsers and devices. Therefore, it is important to develop, if you are
            making a website for general use especially, with flexibility in mind - ensuring that the text will expand
            for example when a user zooms in on a page.

        <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities
            may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them
        </h3>
        <p>One issue that people with disabilities can face when trying to access websites is colour blindness and the
            design of the website not helping this. For example, two common colours which are difficult to differentiate
            between for those who are colour blind are red and green - web designers should perhaps try to be mindful
            therefore of the colours that they are using so that it is accessible for everyone. Blindness is another
            issue which can affect the ability of users to truly engage with a website and read all of the content. Web
            designers can try and ensure that their website is readable by screen readers such as Apple VoiceOver or
            Serotek Systems Access. Such software will read aloud the information on the screen while others might also
            create a braille display of the website content for a user. It is therefore beneficial for designers and
            developers to ensure that their website can be read and engage with such software. </p>

        <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites
        </h3>
        <p>The appropriate file types are ones such as HTML and CSS, which are used to input the content and then the
            style and positioning of that content retrospectively. Languages and file types for the back-end such as
            Javascript or even Python can also be used on a website to add more functionality to the website, perhaps
            such as creating a gallery which continuously scrolls through images on your landing page. </p>
