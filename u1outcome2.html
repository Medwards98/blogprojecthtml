            <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own website, are you
                happy
                with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>
            I found Visual Studio Code very useful and easy to use. I’d used Sublime Text Editor before starting this
            course, which is very similar, but generally VS Code is a bit easier to use, I like the way that every file
            or
            image that is in my main directory is to the side while I am working - this makes it easy for me to keep on
            top
            of what I am building and how many files I have. I love how in VS Code, as well as other programming tools,
            little shortcuts will pop up and things will change colour - for example if you are calling a class in CSS
            it
            will be a certain colour. These features make it easy to tell if you have written your code wrong and
            therefore
            if there’s a reason as to why it’s not working it is easy to find/tell what the problem is.<br>
            Trello is also a very useful tool as it helps me to keep on top of the multitude of tasks which have to be
            completed in order to fully develop my website. While I often update Trello retroactively due to the fact
            that I
            often work in very focused bursts, completing many tasks at once rather than stopping to keep checking
            Trello,
            it is still useful to know what I have done and to know what I still have to do.
        </p>

            <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>
            VS Code was very appropriate as to create a website you of course need some form of text editor/code editor
            and VS Code is as good as any other if not better. Therefore, I would not choose to use a different editor
            in the future instead of VS Code. I would also continue to use Trello in the future but try and have a
            strict
            schedule with myself where I check Trello in the morning, just after lunch and at the end of the day to
            update any more progress. I think Trello is a useful tool but I did not necessarily implement it to its
            full capacity, if I used Trello with this system though I am far more likely to get more use out of
            it.

            <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project - are you happy with your website? Why?
                Why
                not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
            </h3>
            I am generally happy with my website but there are definitely features that I would like to include in the
            future but did not get a chance to include this time. I would have liked the website to be one continuous
            page almost where you scroll or use a down arrow button to get onto the next section but I could not figure
            out how to code this into the site and therefore I could not seem to achieve this effect. Instead I had to
            use a standard navigation system rather than using this more modern and fancy design which is seen in a lot
            of blogs. Also, while I am happy with the landing page of my project I think that the rest of the website is
            not as visually or stylistically interesting. Perhaps this is due to the nature of having larger paragraphs
            of text to read on the screen which means that the background or other visual elements can’t be inserted as
            this would make the large body of text difficult to see but generally I think the rest of the website is not
            as stylistically interesting as the landing page. I perhaps dedicated too much time to styling the landing
            page compared to the rest of the website. Generally though I am happy with the website and think it is a
            good reflection of my personality and interests!
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h3>
            As mentioned above I would code in the continuous scroll, single-page design to my website to make an
            improvement as I think this is a more futuristic and sleek design compared to having a navigation bar. I
            might also split up the outcomes onto multiple different pages so that there is a less big body of text on
            each page and instead there are just more pages. This would hopefully allow the general design and 80s feel
            of the website to shine through as other elements such as the background are not as taken up and hidden by
            text. I would also like to include fun ‘easter eggs’ in the future, such as a working Snake game or
            something similar as this would be a good way to highlight any projects I have made but this would also make
            the website more fun and engaging if there was a game on it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
            I prepared appropriate content for my website by ensuring that all of my content was easy to read, made
            sense and would show up correctly when programmed in and tested. For example, before inputting a gif as the
            background on my landing page I had more text in the ‘about me’ section on that page but after inputting the
            gif it was not aesthetically pleasing to have so much text there with the image clashing in the background.
            Therefore, I reduced the amount of text on that page. I decided to organise my information by having each
            outcome on a different page so that there information was collated enough to not make the website overly
            long but that it was also organised so as to not be confusing for the user. I have used buttons to move from
            one page to another as stylistically this fits with the minimalist design of my website.
