        <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency -
            could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
        </h3>
        <p>As the design of this particular blog is very personal and stylistically close to my own personality, I think
            this sort of project would not benefit from working in a team as this means that not everyone in the team
            would have the chance to show their personality through their blog. For less personal projects, such as
            designing for a client, this would not matter but for a website which discusses you and your own
            interests/answers to questions it makes more sense and creates more stylistic cohesion to work
            independently. Still, I think the tool of Trello could have been implemented more efficiently by myself as
            it has a lot of benefits both in terms of managing your time but also in knowing exactly what your next
            steps are in terms of your project development and ensuring that you have cohesive plan for your project.

        </h3>
        <p>
            While I would not suggest a team work structure on this sort of project, team work could be implemented
            somewhat through Slack. For example, if someone wanted to implement a certain feature or was stuck on how to
            code something onto their website, they could ask the class on Slack and then if someone else had a helpful
            weblink or knew the solution they could send that over or go and help the person face to face. This would
            not make the project a strict collaborative effort but it would allow for the benefits of team work in terms
            of a lighter load of work to be implemented as we could help each other. It is good to draw on each other’s
            knowledge as everyone will have attempted to design their website slightly differently and so will have
            engaged with different coding tools or tricks, knowledge that they can then pass on. As mentioned above
            Trello could have been used more effectively. In the future I would check Trello multiple times a day and
            would set aside time at the end of the day to update the board with exactly what has been completed but more
            importantly to review what has to be completed tomorrow in clear detail.

            Having a clear design and vision before beginning to develop the website would also improve efficiency and
            productivity in the future. I kept changing my mind about what theme and layout I wanted for my website but
            if I had decided this at the start and designed all the pages around this I would have saved time. I also
            think I spent too much time trying to implement certain more complex features such as the continuous scroll,
            single-page design which was mentioned above. Instead, I should have tried to implement the more simple
            features first and also the general content of my website and then I should have tried the more complex
            stuff after. This approach would have saved time and also would have ensured that the design and feel of the
            website was more stylistically sound as the base to build upwards from was already a strong, solid
            foundation.

        <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
        </h3>
        <p>The most important way to test a digital solution pertaining to the development of a blog/website, such as
            this project, is to write the code and then run the website on a local browser (before it is live).
            Furthermore, digital solutions can also be tested by checking against code that other people have written
            for the same problem - using websites like Codepen or Stackoverflow. It is also important when using digital
            solutions to think of simple things like whether buttons match up to where they are supposed to go or
            whether all the text is visible, ensuring that no added margins or boxes have moved text off screen or to an
            unusual place.
